# VolatileGuard: Ensuring Memory Integrity in Rust Applications

VolatileGuard is a Rust library designed to provide robust mechanisms for detecting and mitigating memory corruption issues, particularly those arising from unexpected modifications to critical data structures. This library helps developers build more resilient and reliable applications by proactively guarding against common vulnerabilities and unexpected behavior caused by memory errors.

This library provides wrappers around Rust's standard memory management primitives, injecting checks and validation routines that monitor the integrity of designated memory regions. By strategically wrapping sensitive data with VolatileGuard, developers can detect attempts to modify data outside of allowed boundaries, identify potential buffer overflows, and detect unintended data corruption during runtime. This proactive approach allows developers to identify and address potential problems early in the development cycle, leading to more stable and secure applications. Furthermore, VolatileGuard can be customized with different guarding strategies allowing it to be tailored to the needs of specific applications and security requirements.

VolatileGuard aims to strike a balance between security and performance. While the added integrity checks introduce some overhead, the design prioritizes efficiency by minimizing the impact on overall application performance. The library provides compile-time configuration options to enable or disable certain checks based on the desired level of security and the specific performance constraints of the application. This flexibility enables developers to fine-tune VolatileGuard to achieve the optimal trade-off between protection and speed.

Key Features:

*   **Memory Region Guarding:** Allows developers to designate specific memory regions to be protected against unexpected modifications. Uses Rust's ownership and borrowing rules combined with runtime checks to enforce boundaries.
*   **Data Integrity Validation:** Provides mechanisms for validating the integrity of data stored within protected memory regions. Supports checksums, hash functions, and custom validation routines. Implementation details can be found in the `src/guard.rs` file.
*   **Buffer Overflow Detection:** Implements checks to detect buffer overflows by verifying that write operations do not exceed the boundaries of allocated buffers. Uses size checks within the `VolatileGuard` struct.
*   **Customizable Guarding Strategies:** Offers different guarding strategies to balance security and performance. These can be toggled via feature flags during compilation. The available strategies are defined in the `src/strategies.rs` file.
*   **Error Reporting:** Provides detailed error messages and diagnostic information when memory corruption is detected, facilitating debugging and troubleshooting. Error structures are defined in `src/errors.rs`.
*   **Integration with Existing Code:** Designed to be easily integrated into existing Rust projects with minimal code changes. It primarily involves wrapping existing data structures with `VolatileGuard`.
*   **Compile-Time Configuration:** Allows developers to enable or disable specific checks at compile time to optimize performance. Controlled via feature flags in the `Cargo.toml` file.

Technology Stack:

*   **Rust:** The core programming language used to build VolatileGuard. Rust's memory safety features contribute to the overall security of the library.
*   **Cargo:** Rust's package manager, used for building, testing, and managing dependencies.
*   **Standard Library:** Utilizes Rust's standard library for basic data structures, error handling, and input/output operations.
*   **Hashing Algorithms (Optional):** May use hashing algorithms from crates like `sha2` or `blake3` (enabled via feature flags) for data integrity validation.

Installation:

1.  Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. You can download them from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2.  Add VolatileGuard as a dependency to your `Cargo.toml` file:

    [dependencies]
    volatileguard = "0.1.0" # Replace with the latest version
3.  Run `cargo build` to download and compile the library.

Configuration:

VolatileGuard can be configured using environment variables and feature flags in your `Cargo.toml` file.

*   **Feature Flags:**
    *   `checksum`: Enables checksum-based data integrity validation (adds `sha2` as a dependency). Add `volatileguard = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["checksum"] }` to your `Cargo.toml`.
    *   `debug_checks`: Enables more verbose debug checks, slowing down execution but providing more detailed error information.
*   **Environment Variables:** No environment variables are currently supported, but future versions may introduce options for configuring error reporting behavior.

Usage:

To use VolatileGuard, wrap your sensitive data with the `VolatileGuard` struct.
